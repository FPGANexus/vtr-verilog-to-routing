/**
 * @file 
 * @brief This file defines the NocTrafficFlows class, which contains all
 * communication betwee routers in the NoC.
 * 
 * Overview
 * ======== 
 * The NocTrafficFlows class contains a list of t_noc_traffic_flow in a given 
 * design. Each traffic flow is indexed by a unique id that can be used to
 * retrieve information about them.  
 * 
 * The class also associates traffic flows to their source routers (start point)
 * and sink routers (end point). This is useful if one wants to find traffic
 * flows based on just the source or sink router.
 * 
 * The routes for the traffic flows are expected to change throughout placement
 * as routers will be moved throughout the chip. Therefore this class provides
 * a datastructure to keep track of which flows have been updated (re-routed).
 * 
 * Finally, this class also stores a list of all router blocks in the design.
 * 
 * This class will be primarily used during 
 * placement to identify which routers inside the NoC(NocStorage) need to
 * routed to each other.This is important since the router modules can be moved
 * around to different tiles on the FPGA device.
